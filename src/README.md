Skip Lists Assignment
=====================

Some starter code for the skip list assignment.

### Analysis
First, three scatter plots have been created for the set, get, and remove methods.

Next, here is the table used for these plots. It was collected by the SkipListExpt class:

'''text
       |100     |1000    |10000   |100000  |1000000 |10000000|
Set    |5       |9       |12      |18      |21      |24      |
Get    |4       |10      |11      |16      |18      |23      |
Remove |5       |10      |14      |19      |21      |23      |
'''

These togather clearly show some kind of logarithmic function as the slope of the function approaches zero as n
grows larger and large. I would highly reccomend looking at the scatterplots.

Coolio. Sams out.
